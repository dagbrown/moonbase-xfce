cat << EOF
xfce4-time-out-plugin is a plugin for the Xfce panel. It's a comfortable tool
for taking a break from computer work every now  and then. You can define a
working interval and whenever time of this interval has passed your screen is
locked for a configurable amount of time - which gives you enough time to grab
a cup of coffee, smoke a cigarette or even do something healthy like eating,
exercising, cleaning up or whatever.
